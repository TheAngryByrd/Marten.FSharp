# Marten.FSharp

A set of FSharp wrappers around [Marten](https://github.com/JasperFx/marten) (Postgresql as a Document Database and Event Store for .Net Applications )

The API is a work in progress and will change as people give me feedback.

The goal is to be similar to https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.Reactive.

You can find working examples in the the [tests](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/Marten.FSharp/blob/master/tests/Marten.FSharp.Tests/Tests.fs)
